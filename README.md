 CS3520 REPOSITORY
 The name of my program is "Prime Reversable Squares".It can be opened using VSCode compiler and DevC++ compiler.
 My program determines and prints the first 10 reversable prime squares.

- Each number MUST possess the following attributes:
												1. it's not a palindrome, 
												2. must be a square of a prime number,
												3. its reverse is a square of a prime number
            
 It has been implemented using C language and MIPS assembly language.
 You first enter the upper limit of the range you want to search the first prime reversable squares and then it will automatically print out the required
 numbers by calling all implemented nested functions.
